          "content": "In this article, we explored the evolving landscape of AI agents and their design patterns, highlighting how agentic frameworks have democratized the development of complex AI systems. By discussing foundational concepts and practical implementations like the ReAct pattern, we demonstrated that simpler, cost-effective architectures can often solve specific tasks efficiently. We also examined advanced multi-agent systems, planning agents, and reflection frameworks that enhance AI capabilities.",

          "content": "In the recent survey paper on the subject of Deep Research, four architectures were proposed: monolithic, pipeline-based, multi-agent and hybrid (combines elements from the previous 3). All of these architecture types consist of the same components: Foundation Model, Task Planning, Tools and API Integrations, Web Browsing, State Management (Memory), Source Evaluation (Validation, Fact Checking), and Output Generation. The difference is how these components are integrated and who controls the [...] Image 11\n\nA Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications\n\nThe Multi-agent architecture consists of several agents that collaborate to produce the final answer. They all connected via a message bus and use separate memory instances. The execution flow here is fully dynamic and based on the Agents' specialisations. This architecture requires an Agent Coordination Layer.\n\nImage 12\n\nA Comprehensive Survey of Deep Research: Systems, Methodologies, and Applications",

What are the challenges of designing multi-agent systems? Designing multi-agent systems (MAS) presents several challenges due to the complexity of coordinating multiple autonomous entities. These systems require agents to interact, communicate, and make decisions in shared environments, which introduces issues like coordination overhead, scalability, and handling uncertainty. To address this, developers often implement protocols like contract net (where agents bid for tasks) or publish-subscribe systems. Additionally, privacy concerns arise when agents share sensitive information, requiring techniques like federated learning or secure multi-party computation, which complicate system design and maintenance. Zilliz Cloud is a managed vector database built on Milvus perfect for building GenAI applications.",
